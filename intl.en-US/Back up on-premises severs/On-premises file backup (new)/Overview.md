# Overview

Hybrid Backup Recovery \(HBR\) is a fully managed online backup service that allows you to back up data to the cloud in an efficient, secure, and cost-effective manner. You can use an HBR backup client to back up files from an on-premises server or virtual machine \(VM\) in the HBR console. You can then restore the files if they are lost or damaged.

You can perform the following operations to back up files from and restore files to on-premises servers or VMs:

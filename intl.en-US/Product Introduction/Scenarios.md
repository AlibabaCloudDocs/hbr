# Scenarios

Hybrid Backup Recovery \(HBR\) supports the backing up of data from physical machines, VMWare or Hyper-V virtual machines, cloud virtual machines, and workflow-based data sources. You can use HBR in the following scenario:

## Back up data from local data centers

When failures occur in a local data center and cannot be immediately fixed, you can restore data from an Alibaba Cloud backup vault by using a specific application.

## Back up data from Alibaba Cloud

Back up data that is stored on Alibaba Cloud virtual machines and use the internal network bandwidth to back up data to HBR backup vaults.

## Manage the backup of data from multiple branches

You can use HBR to back up data across multiple local and cloud branches. You can also back up cloud data to other regions to implement geo-disaster recovery. This ensures the availability of data and services. By centralizing the backup of data from multiple regions, you can reduce management costs.

## Back up workflow-based data sources

You can use HBR to back up workflow-based data sources to ensure data security. HBR supports data sources, such as SAP HANA, SQL Server, MySQL, and MongoDB.

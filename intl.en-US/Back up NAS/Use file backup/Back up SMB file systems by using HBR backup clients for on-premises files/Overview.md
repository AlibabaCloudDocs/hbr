# Overview

You can use Hybrid Backup Recovery \(HBR\) backup clients for on-premises files to back up files from user-created Server Message Block \(SMB\) file systems. You can then restore the files if they are lost or damaged.

**Note:** This backup method is only applicable to regions where ECS backup is not supported. For regions that support ECS backup, we recommend that you [use an HBR backup client for ECS to back up files from SMB file systems](/intl.en-US/Back up NAS/Use file backup/Back up SMB file systems by using backup clients for ECS/Overview.md).

You can use the following procedure to back up files from an SMB file system:

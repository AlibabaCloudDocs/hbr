# Overview {#concept_978534 .concept}

You can use a local file backup client to back up SMB NAS files in a local IDC and restore the files when they are lost or damaged.

**Note:** This backup mode is only applicable to regions that do not support ECS backup. For regions that support ECS backup, we recommend that you [use an ECS file backup client to back up SMB NAS files](intl.en-US/Back up NAS/Use an ECS file backup client to back up SMB NAS files/Overview.md#).

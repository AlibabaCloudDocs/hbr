# Back up data from cloud resources

This topic describes the backup feature for cloud resources. You can use Hybrid Backup Recovery \(HBR\) to back up data from Alibaba Cloud resources and self-managed data centers in a secure and efficient way. This feature is suitable for Alibaba Cloud resources that are deployed on Elastic Compute Service \(ECS\), Apsara File Storage NAS, and Object Storage Service \(OSS\).

The following figure shows the architecture of the HBR backup feature. This feature is applicable to ECS file systems, NAS files, OSS files, self-managed SQL Server databases on ECS instances, and self-managed SAP HANA database resources on ECS instances. For more information, see [Best practices for HBR-based backup of Alibaba Cloud resources](https://bp.aliyun.com/detail/125).

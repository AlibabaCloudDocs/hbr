# What should I do if an error occurs while installing a client because the installation process times out or the client failed to start? {#concept_d2g_tkl_ngb .concept}

This issue occurs when anti-virus software such as Qihoo 360 blocks the installation process. You can stop anti-virus software and reinstall the client.

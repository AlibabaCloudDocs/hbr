# What should I do if a backup job fails to run after I restart the Cloud Assistant client? {#concept_wkt_zwh_wgb .concept}

When you use Hybrid Backup Recovery to back up data, you need to install the Cloud Assistant client on the ECS instance if the instance is located in a classic network. After the Cloud Assistant client is installed, you need to configure the `region-id` file and then [restart the Cloud Assistant client](../../../../intl.en-US/Deployment & Maintenance/Cloud assistant/Configure the cloud assistant client.md#section_rlc_n2x_ydb).

# Why am I prompted an error message indicating the checksum fails on the client after I update the client on an ECS instance? {#concept_rn4_xkl_ngb .concept}

The client is uninstalled or the ECS instance is stopped. If the client is uninstalled, reinstall the client in the HBR console. If the instance is stopped, restart the ECS instance.

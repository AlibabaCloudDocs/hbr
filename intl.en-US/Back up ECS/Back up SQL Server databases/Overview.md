Hybrid Backup Recovery \(HBR\) is a fully managed online backup service that allows you to back up data to the cloud in an efficient, secure, and cost-effective way. You can use an Alibaba Cloud Elastic Compute Service \(ECS\) backup client for HBR to back up SQL Server databases deployed on ECS instances and restore these databases as required.

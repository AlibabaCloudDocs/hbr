# Overview

Hybrid Backup Recovery \(HBR\) is a fully managed online backup service that allows you to back up data to the cloud in an efficient, secure, and cost-effective manner. You can use an HBR backup client for Elastic Compute Service \(ECS\) to back up files from an ECS instance in the HBR console. You can then restore the files if they are lost or damaged. HBR backs up and restores files in the streaming mode.

You can perform the following operations to back up files from and restore files to ECS instances:

-   [Preparations]()
-   [Back up files from ECS instances]()
-   [Restore files to an ECS instance]()

**Note:** For more information about how to back up on-premises files, see [Overview](/intl.en-US/Back up on-premises severs/File backup/Overview.md).
